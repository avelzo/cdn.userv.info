# Fix for Folder ID Issues

## Problem Discovered

The root cause of the folder ID issues was a **database connection problem** in the `.env.local` file.

### Wrong Configuration
```bash
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/cdn"
```

### Correct Configuration  
```bash
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/cdn_userv"
```

## Impact

When using the wrong database name (`cdn` instead of `cdn_userv`):

❌ **What was happening:**
- Application couldn't find existing folders and files
- Created new folders with different IDs in wrong database
- Manager showed empty or incorrect folder structure
- API calls used non-existent folder IDs like `68f77b9d7d66634a7609d5de`

✅ **What happens with correct database:**
- Application finds existing 6 folders (Racine, Documents, Images, Icônes, Photos, Vidéos)
- Uses correct root folder ID: `68f691a7d5ad267e7551e944`
- Displays 1 existing file: `avelzo_sketch-avatar.png`
- All folder navigation and file operations work correctly

## Solution Applied

1. **Updated `.env.local`** with correct database name
2. **Verified database connection** shows 6 folders + 1 file
3. **Complete URLs functionality** remains working as implemented

## Files with Complete URLs

The CDN now generates complete URLs for all files:

**Original file:**
```

```

**Thumbnails:**

```

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

Both issues are now fixed:
- ✅ Complete URLs for external access  
- ✅ Correct folder structure and file management
